There is 4 possible ways to create a If Clause ( conditional statements with if) in English.

| Type |     Clause     |            Condition / Main Clause            |
| :--: | :------------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
|  1   | Simple Present |                Simple Present                 |
|  2   | Simple Present |                 Future terms                  |
|  3   |  Simple Past   |           Would, Could, Might + ...           |
|  4   |  Past Perfect  | Would, Could, Might + have + past participate |

First Type, is always fulfilled.
e.g. **If you heat ice, It melts**

Second Type, is possible to fulfil
e.g. **If I study, I will pass the exam**

Third Type, in theory, its possible to fulfill
e.g. **If I warmed up, I wouldn't injure**

Last type, its not possible to fulfill because its too late
e.g. **If I had saved money from my birthdays, I might have been rich.**
