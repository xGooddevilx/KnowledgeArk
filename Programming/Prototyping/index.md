# What is Prototyping

## Prototype term

The term prototype refers to an "initial sample" or "experimental model." In English, "proto" means "first" or "preliminary," and "type" means "kind" or "form."
Therefore, a prototype signifies an initial form or version created for testing and evaluating an idea, design, or new product.

This sample is typically simple and incomplete, but it demonstrates enough of the core features and functionalities to gather feedback.

## In software development

as we talked earlier, a prototype is an early version of an application that is built to demonstrate and test concepts, features and user interfaces.

Prototypes allows developers and stakeholders to explore and validate design concepts before full-scale development begins. by providing a tangible model of the software, enables users to interact with it and offer feedback of it.
also you can identify issues early and reduce the risk of costly changes later in development process.

Prototypes can vary in fidelity, from low-fidelity sketches or wireframes to high-fidelity interactive models that closely resemble the final product.

### Prototyping and Prototyping model

Prototyping is defined as the process of developing a working replication of a product or system that has to be engineered. in the other word, it refers to the process of building a preliminary version of a user interface or core functionalities. This version may not have all the features of the final product, but it's close enough to provide an overall sense of how the product will work, allowing the team to test and refine the idea.

this model is used when the customers don't know the exact project requirements beforehand.
in this process, the system is partially implemented before or during the analysis phase.

## Conclusion

In summary, prototyping plays a crucial role in software development by allowing teams to visualize and test ideas before full implementation. It facilitates early feedback from users and stakeholders, which can lead to more effective and user-centered designs. By embracing prototyping, development teams can identify potential issues early, reduce risks, and adapt to changes more effectively. Ultimately, this iterative process not only enhances the final product but also fosters collaboration and communication between developers and users, ensuring that the end result aligns with user needs and expectations.
