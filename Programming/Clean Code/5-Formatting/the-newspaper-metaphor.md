# The newspaper metaphor

Just as a well-written newspaper article allows readers to quickly catch the main ideas without confusion, your code should be easy to read and understand.
It should tell us the main intent clearly, allowing you and others to easily understand what the code does without complexity. The goal is to make the code as clear and neat as possible, just like good journalism.
