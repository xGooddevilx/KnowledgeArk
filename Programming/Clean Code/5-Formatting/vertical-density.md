# Vertical Density

Imagine you have a variable called `isLoading` and another one named `disabled`. If `isLoading` is at the top of your file and `disabled` is buried down at line 3001, your code is unclear. Vertical density means that related lines and codes should be kept close together. By placing `isLoading` and `disabled` near each other, your code is easier to read and shows their connection clearly. When related concepts are far apart, it can lead to misunderstandings and make it tougher to see how they work together, ultimately harming the quality of your code.
