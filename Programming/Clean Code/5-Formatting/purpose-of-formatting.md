# The Purpose of Code Formatting

Imagine your room is a mess, you're late for school, and you've lost your other sock. You have to search every nook and cranny in your room to find it.

Isn't it faster and easier if everything is in its place? Imagine if your room were organized so neatly that even if someone came looking for their belt, they would find it immediately.

Of course! A clean and organized space allows anyone to find what they need quickly.

## Code Formatting Is Similar

Formatting code is exactly like this. If you are working on a team, everyone should understand your code: where you put constants, where you add types, where you implement APIs, and so on.

In a team, everyone should agree on a set of formatting rules that everyone can follow. This ensures smooth collaboration and understanding.

While creating perfect logic—like that of NASA's spaceships—is great, remember that your logic will evolve over time. However, the readability of your code will not.

## Communication Through Formatting

Formatting is a way of communication between team members, and effective communication is the first order of business for professional developers.

Good and clean formatting sets a precedent that continues to affect maintainability and extensibility long after the original code has been changed.
